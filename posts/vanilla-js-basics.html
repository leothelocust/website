<h1>Vanilla JS Basics</h1>

<p><em>Warning: This article turned out to be a bit of rant.  So if you are the type to get offended when I say negative things about JavaScript, you are welcome to leave.</em></p>

<p>JavaScript is what I consider to be an &quot;easy&quot; language.  Now what do I mean by that?  Well, its usually the first <em>scripting</em> language that new developers learn, and you can get started with very little &quot;training&quot;.  It has a relatively simple syntax.  It can be very powerful.  So from my point of view, its an easy language to pick up.  And therein lies the problem.</p>

<p>So many of the JavaScript programmers out there today hear the term &quot;JavaScript&quot; and think in there mind &quot;jQuery&quot;.  Now that&#39;s great to have that kind of brand recognition if you are jQuery, but if you are looking to be an efficient programmer that doesn&#39;t put holes in everything you make, you may want to consider that JavaScript is NOT jQuery.</p>

<p>Additionally, we need to start thinking about the consequences of using third-party libraries for everything.  Longer load times, additional security risks, more memory consumption, and the list goes on.</p>

<p>I want to give you at least a few little snippets of vanilla JavaScript that will get you on your way to not importing jQuery on every project as a <em>step 1</em>.  It should be near the end of your steps and only as needed.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: Vanilla JavaScript will be longer (i.e. more verbose), but this isn&#39;t always a bad thing.  Keep in mind that we are eliminating the import of another package, and all the bloat that comes with it.</em></p>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<p>For starters, I&#39;m assuming that you getting this far means that you at least have heard of JavaScript.  If you have not heard of jQuery, <strong>leave now</strong>, I don&#39;t want &quot;introducing someone to jQuery&quot; to be what you get out of this.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s begin...</p>

<h3>Selecting Element in the DOM</h3>

<p>jQuery</p>

<pre><code>    $(&#39;#myID&#39;)</code></pre>

<p>Vanilla JavaScript</p>

<pre><code>    document.getElementById(&#39;myID&#39;)</code></pre>

<p>Again, note that vanilla JavaScript is longer, but its actually more descriptive of what is going on here.  Unless you are familiar with jQuery (yes, I know you are) the jQuery syntax doesn&#39;t tell you what its doing.</p>

<h3>Replace Text/HTML in the DOM</h3>

<p>jQuery</p>

<pre><code>    $(&#39;#myID&#39;).html(&#39;here is the replacement&#39;)</code></pre>

<p>Vanilla JavaScript</p>

<pre><code>    document.getElementById(&#39;myID&#39;).innerHTML(&#39;here is the replacement&#39;)</code></pre>

<p>Very similar eh.  However, there is actually some performance gain by using vanilla JavaScript.  See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3563107/jquery-html-vs-innerhtml#answer-3563136">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Click Handling in the DOM</h3>

<p>jQuery</p>

<pre><code>    $(&#39;#myID&#39;).click(function() {
        alert(&#39;Clicked it!&#39;)
    })</code></pre>

<p>Vanilla JavaScript</p>

<pre><code>    document.getElementById(&#39;myID&#39;).addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, function(e) {
        alert(&#39;Clicked it!&#39;)
    })</code></pre>

<p>So easy.</p>

<h3>Advanced Queries and Iteration</h3>

<p>jQuery</p>

<pre><code>    $(&#39;.item&#39;).hide()</code></pre>

<p>Vanilla JavaScript</p>

<pre><code>    var items = document.getElementsByClassName(&#39;.items&#39;)
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; items.length; i++) {
        item[i].style.display = &#39;none&#39;
    }</code></pre>

<p>We&#39;re starting to see the verbosity I mentioned above, but again, remember that we aren&#39;t loading in a massive third-party library!</p>

<h3>Even More Advanced</h3>

<p>See Patrick Kunka&#39;s article <a href="https://blog.wearecolony.com/a-year-without-jquery/">A Year Without jQuery</a></p>

<p>Patrick and I agree on many of the same points and his article articulates some helper functions that can be used to perform more advanced loops, child selection and child indexing.  I highly recommend you read through his article.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you find that your requirements heavily rely on JavaScript for DOM manipulation, or that you need animations such as the ones provided by jQuery, then don&#39;t let me stop you.  But if you only need some of what was covered above, or you want to put a priority on performance, then you should really consider going with plain vanilla JavaScript and leave the dependencies behind.  You won&#39;t regret it.</p>
